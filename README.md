# 5-Ingredient Recipe Webapp
This is a webapp that displays five-ingredient recipes. It aims to help the world spend less time cooking, and more time connecting.

**Link to API:** https://ash-recipe-api.herokuapp.com

### :construction: This webapp is actively under construction! ###

## Some Notes:

**Tech used:**  HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript

I love to cook, and I **still** want to spend less time doing it. I built this without any frameworks so I could continue strenghthening my fundamental skills further.

## Optimizations (Coming soon)

1. Stepping up the styling on this page 
2. Adding more recipes, photos, and the cooking instructions with all recipes. 
3. Rendering the recipes with EJS templating server-side.
