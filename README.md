## Some Notes:

**Tech used:**  HTML, CSS, vanilla Javascript

I love to cook, and I **still** want to spend less time doing it. I'm betting you feel this way as well. 

Note: I built this without any frameworks so I could continue strenghthening my fundamental skills further.

## Optimizations (Coming soon)

1. Stepping up the styling on this page 
2. Adding more recipes, photos, and the cooking instructions with all recipes. 
3. Rendering the recipes with EJS templating server-side.
